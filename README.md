develop-assert
==============

A test-driven development exercise in developing an assertion utility.

Exercise 1
----------
Execute the following in terminal window:
```
fpm test
```
Let the error messages guide you to the code that you need to write in the
[./src](./src) subdirectory to make the test pass.  Also, see the 
[design documentation](./doc/exercise-1) for Unified Modeling Language (UML)
class diagrams of the `parabola_t` derived type involved in the test.
